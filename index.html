                <p>
                    Mercury is the smallest and innermost planet in our solar system. Despite its proximity to the Sun,
                    it's
                    not the hottest planet (that title belongs to Venus).

                    Size: Slightly larger than Earth's Moon. <br>
                    Temperature: Extreme temperature variations, from scorching hot days to freezing cold nights due to
                    its
                    lack of a significant atmosphere.   <br>
                    Surface: Heavily cratered, suggesting a long history of asteroid impacts.   <br>
                    Orbit: The fastest orbit of any planet in our solar system, completing a revolution around the Sun
                    in
                    just 88 Earth days.

                    Venus is often referred to as Earth's "twin" due to its similar size, mass, and composition.
                    However, its surface conditions are vastly different, making it one of the most hostile environments
                    in our solar system.

                    degrees Fahrenheit (462 degrees Celsius).<br>
                    Atmosphere: Extremely thick and dense, composed primarily of carbon dioxide. This greenhouse effect
                    traps heat, causing the high temperatures.
